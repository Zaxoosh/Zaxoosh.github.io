                  During my time working as the Head of Staff for a competitor
                  to OpenAI's Chatgpt, I played a critical role in establishing
                  and growing the project's community. As the equivalent of a
                  Discord Community Manager, my responsibilities involved
                  organizing the organizational structure of the project and
                  filling various positions through a rigorous interview
                  process.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In addition to these responsibilities, I also created an
                  online clock-in system to monitor staff activity and
                  progression. This helped us to ensure that all team members
                  were contributing their fair share and working towards our
                  common goals.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  To further engage and excite our community, I organized
                  several contests, including an art contest, which drew in many
                  talented artists who submitted their work for consideration.
                  These contests helped us to build a sense of community and
                  fostered a spirit of friendly competition among our members.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Thanks to these efforts and our team's hard work, we were able
                  to grow our community to an impressive 20,000 members in just
                  three days! We also made continuous updates to the Discord
                  server and eventually moved over to Matrix via Element to
                  better manage and scale our operations.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  As part of my efforts to improve our management and
                  moderation, I created and set up a bot system that integrated
                  into the server. This system helped to automate many of the
                  moderation and management tasks, freeing up our team members
                  to focus on more creative and strategic work.

                <span>
                  Overall, my work as the Head of Staff for this competitor to
                  OpenAI's Chatgpt helped to establish and grow a vibrant
                  community around our project. I am proud to have played a
                  critical role in this success and to have contributed to the
                  growth and development of the project.

                  At The Crypto Golfers, I worked as a social media manager
                  where I was responsible for creating and scheduling weekly
                  content across all our social media platforms. My role
                  involved working closely with a team of graphic designers and
                  video editors to produce engaging content for our audience,
                  such as daily clips and our weekly main video.

                  audience engagement, and analytics tracking. By leveraging
                  these skills, I was able to effectively manage our social
                  media presence and increase our reach and engagement with our
                  followers.

                to the rest of the Zuvvii team in a Whitepaper, which was
                well-received. To ensure effective communication and
